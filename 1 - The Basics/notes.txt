Modulo vs Remainder
  The modulo operator looks like % and is used like 16 % 5 => 1
  The remainder method is used like 16.remainder(5) => 1
  - The #divmod method returns an array containing both the reuslt of division and modulo of two values.
  - There are two key differences between modulo and remainder:
      Modulo operations return a positive integer when the second operand is positive, and a negative integer when the second operand is negative.
      Remainder operations return a positive integer when the frist operand is positive, and a negative integer when the first operand is negative.
      - Because of these differences, and to avoid confusion, you should try to work exclusively with positive integers when trying to calculate modulo or remainder.
        If you can't, then make sure you know exactly which operator or method to use when working with negative integers.
